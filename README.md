# Fine-Tuning Phi-2 for Telecommunications Q&A

This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the Phi-2 language model for a telecommunications question-answering task. We'll go through the following steps:

1. **Setup**: Install required libraries and mount Google Drive
2. **Model Preparation**: Load and prepare the Phi-2 model for fine-tuning
3. **Data Processing**: Load and format the training data
4. **Training**: Fine-tune the model using LoRA
5. **Evaluation**: Monitor training and validation loss
6. **Inference**: Test the model on new questions using various prompting strategies
7. **Output**: Generate predictions and create submission files

## Key Components

- **Model**: tiiuae/falcon-7b
- **Quantization**: 4-bit quantization for efficient training
- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Prompting Strategies**:
  - Basic prompting
  - Chain of thought
  - Few-shot learning
  - Self-consistency

Let's begin by setting up our environment and loading the necessary libraries.
