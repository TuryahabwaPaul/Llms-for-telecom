# 📡 Fine-Tuning Phi-2 for Telecommunications Q&A

Welcome to the **Phi-2 Fine-Tuning Project** for question-answering in the telecommunications domain. This notebook focuses on training a powerful language model to excel at answering technical questions about telecom standards using advanced fine-tuning techniques.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

In this project, we fine-tune the **Phi-2 language model** specifically for the task of **Telecommunications Q&A**. The fine-tuning is performed using **QLoRA**, a low-rank adaptation technique combined with 4-bit quantization, making the process efficient even on resource-constrained machines.

Our goals are to:
- Enhance the Phi-2 model's accuracy in answering complex telecom-related questions.
- Experiment with multiple prompting strategies to improve the quality of the responses.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 🛠️ Step 1: Setup
We begin by installing the necessary libraries, setting up the environment, and mounting Google Drive for data access and storage.

### 🧠 Step 2: Model Preparation
- **Phi-2 Model**: We load the pre-trained Phi-2 model.
- **Quantization**: Apply 4-bit quantization for efficient fine-tuning.

### 📊 Step 3: Data Processing
- **Training Data**: Format and preprocess the telecom question-answer dataset.
- **Data Splits**: Split the data into training and validation sets for accurate model evaluation.

### 🚀 Step 4: Model Training
- **Fine-Tuning**: Use the **QLoRA** technique to fine-tune the model efficiently on the training data.
- **Training Monitoring**: Continuously monitor both training and validation loss to ensure proper convergence.

### 🔍 Step 5: Evaluation
- **Validation**: Evaluate the model on validation data and adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

### 🧩 Step 6: Inference & Prompting
- **Prompting Strategies**:
  - Basic Prompting
  - Chain of Thought (CoT)
  - Few-shot Learning
  - Self-consistency
  
  Experiment with these strategies to maximize the quality of the generated answers.

### 📂 Step 7: Submission
- **Generate Predictions**: Use the fine-tuned model to answer unseen questions.
- **Create Submission Files**: Format the results for submission.
